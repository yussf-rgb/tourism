  <p>The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: tour Eiffel [tuʁ‿ɛfɛl] (About this soundlisten)) is a wrought-iron lattice
  tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and
  built the tower.
  
  Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticised by some of France's
  leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most
  recognisable structures in the world.[3</p>

Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the
